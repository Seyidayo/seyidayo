I'm a Software Engineer passionate about creating the best possible experience for the user in any way I can, I obsess over accessibilty, load time, bundle sizes and best practices-*I come from a place with poor internet, so I know how it feels*, I love the devtools a lot, there is so much to be learnt from there.

Technologies I love to work with are Vue, NuxtJs and React, I'm really interested in the Jamstack and how it can be used to acheive my passion.

#### This month (Nov., 2020) I shall be Learning a thing or 2 about
* Documenation and technical writting
* Nuxt and Vue 3
* React and Redux
